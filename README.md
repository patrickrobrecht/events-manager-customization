# Events Manager Customization

This extension for the booking for the [Events Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/) 
plugin by Markus Sykes allows to make the phone number required and add required fields for the postal address.

The code is inspired by [Add custom fields to event form](https://www.b-website.com/events-manager-wordpress-add-custom-fields-event-form).

## Changelog

### 1.0.0
- Allow to make the phone number field in the booking form required.
- Allow to add require additional fields for the postal address (street, postal code and city) to the booking form
    and show the booking list in the admin area.
